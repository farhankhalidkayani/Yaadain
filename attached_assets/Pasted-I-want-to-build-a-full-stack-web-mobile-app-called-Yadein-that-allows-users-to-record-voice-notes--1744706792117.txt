I want to build a full-stack web & mobile app called Yadein that allows users to record voice notes, transcribe them into text using OpenAI’s GPT-4 API, and then store them as digital stories. The app should also offer a subscription model for unlimited storage and allow users to order physical books of their memories.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js (for web) and React Native (for mobile)

Backend: Node.js with Express

Database & Storage: Firebase (Firestore for data, Firebase Storage for voice notes & images)

Authentication: Firebase Auth (Google login & email/password login)

AI Features: OpenAI GPT-4 API for transcribing and enhancing stories

Payment Integration: Stripe (for subscriptions & book purchases)

Core Features & Functionality
1. User Authentication:
Allow users to sign up and log in using Google or email/password.

Store user profile info (name, email, profile picture).

2. Voice Note Recording & Storage:
Users can record a voice note (up to 5 minutes).

Store voice notes in Firebase Storage.

Display a list of recorded memories on the user’s dashboard.

3. AI-Powered Story Generation:
Once a voice note is recorded, send it to OpenAI’s Whisper API for transcription.

Use GPT-4 to enhance the story by asking follow-up questions.

Store the final transcribed story in Firestore.

4. Digital Memory Book:
Users can view and edit their stories.

Allow users to upload Polaroid-style images to attach to stories.

Option to download a free digital version of their memory book.

5. Subscription Model:
Free Users: Can save up to 3 books.

Premium Users ($5/month via Stripe):

Unlimited book storage.

Ability to create a Year-End Memory Book with their best stories.

15% discount on physical book purchases.

6. Physical Book Ordering System:
Users can select stories and images to order a printed memory book.

Stripe integration for payment processing.

After purchase, generate a print-ready PDF of the book.

7. User Dashboard:
Show a list of saved stories with edit & delete options.

Show subscription status and upgrade option.

Additional Notes:
The app should have a clean, modern UI with a sentimental & nostalgic feel.

Ensure mobile responsiveness for both web & mobile users.

Implement a simple admin panel to manage orders & subscriptions.

Please generate the React (frontend) and Node.js (backend) code with Firebase integration to start building this app.
